# Contributor Guideline
## Branching model
We have two branches: master and dev
1. The `master` branch always works without any errors
2. Features are first developed in a separate feature branch `feature/<name of feature>` and after completition merged into the `dev` branch


## Tests 
We move fast. So no tests for now ;)

## Deployment
The master branch is automatically deployed on netlify.
